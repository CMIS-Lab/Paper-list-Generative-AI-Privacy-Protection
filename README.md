* **[2023.02.09]** **[Adversarial Example Does Good: Preventing Painting Imitation from Diffusion Models via Adversarial Examples](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Wbquvk97t4)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ICML'23-6c757d) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hypknot74/Paper-summaries?style=social)](https://github.com/hypknot74/Paper-summaries)
  * Chumeng Liang, Xiaoyu Wu, Yang Hua, Jiaru Zhang, Yiming Xue, Tao Song, Zhengui XUE, Ruhui Ma, Haibing Guan
  * **📝 Summary**: AdvDM is among the first to tackle this task and reduces the performance (image quality) of diffusion models when using hostile samples in tasks such as T2I and I2I.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) -  Diffusion models enable easy style imitation, yet there are no effective methods to prevent or track such infringements.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - AdvDM creates an adversarial sample by optimizing perturbations to maximize loss by Monte Carlo estimation for various latent variables sampled during the retrodispersion process.

* **[2023.11.22]** **[MetaCloak: Preventing Unauthorized Subject-driven Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis via Meta-learning]([https://openreview.net/forum?id=Wbquvk97t4](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_MetaCloak_Preventing_Unauthorized_Subject-driven_Text-to-image_Diffusion-based_Synthesis_via_Meta-learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf))** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CVPR'24-6c757d) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/liuyixin-louis/MetaCloak?style=social)](https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/MetaCloak)
  * Yixin Liu, Chenrui Fan, Yutong Dai, Xun Chen, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun
  * **📝 Summary**: Primarily addresses the transferability and robustness issues of adversarial-based methods targeting personalized generative model.  
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) -  Defines existing adversarial-based methods for personalized generation as a bi-level optimization problem, which hand-crafted approaches struggle to handle.  
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Solves the bi-level optimization problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation.


<h4 id="Privacy-Preserving 2024"> 2024 </h4>

* **[2024.05.31]** **[Watermark-embedded Adversarial Examples for Copyright Protection against Diffusion Models](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_Watermark-embedded_Adversarial_Examples_for_Copyright_Protection_against_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CVPR'24-6c757d) 
  * Peifei Zhu, Tsubasa Takahashi, Hirokatsu Kataoka
  * **📝 Summary**: A fast and visible solution for protecting and tracing copyrighted content from imitation by diffusion models.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Generates adversarial samples to prevent copyright infringement by diffusion models, forcing them to produce visibly watermarked images for copyright tracking.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Uses a conditional GAN to train a generator for crafting adversarial examples.

* **[2024.06.21]** **[EvilEdit: Backdooring Text-to-Image Diffusion Models in One Second](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ibEaSS6bQn)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACMMM'24-6c757d) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/haowang02/EvilEdit?style=social)](https://github.com/haowang02/EvilEdit)
  * Hao Wang, Shangwei Guo, Jialing He, Kangjie Chen, Shudong Zhang, Tianwei Zhang, Tao Xiang
  * **📝 Summary**: Backdoor insertion for text-to-image diffusion models is achieved in a training-free and data-free manner by adopting a lightweight model editing approach.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - A closed-form global minimizer of backdoor model weights derived from the loss function removes the reliance on poisoned datasets and fine-tuning.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Projection matrices in the cross-attention layers of the diffusion model are directly edited to align the trigger with its corresponding backdoor target.
